# Project selection

Since the number of open-source application that i'm using is really low i decided to browse the internet and thus find this project.
The project seems quite young and thus only beginning but I find the concept interesting. When i need to learn a language or another
technology, I always find myself in difficulty to create exercice to practice by myself and end up in tutorials videos and so on...

I did my bachelor in High School and had some courses about web development. I think i could bring something to this project and would therefore like to contribute to it.

Those are the actual issues but i think that other stuff might follow since the youth of the project.

https://github.com/rishipurwar1/coding-space/issues/24

I'm willing to participate to all of them and maybe more to start my journey in the open-source world
