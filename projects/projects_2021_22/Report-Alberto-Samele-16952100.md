# Chapter 1 - Scavenger hunting

Everything must start from something, and so does my journey in the Open Source world.
It all began with my search for an exciting project to work on. I knew that I wanted to dwell deep into something iOS related, being an iOS Software Engineer myself, but the main question still laid unanswered: *what should I contribute to?*

*What should I contribute to*... such a broad question. By typing "Swift" in the GitHub search bar, over 200000 repositories are found. That's right, those are 5 zeros right there.
Well, let's start off by saying what I *don't* want to contribute to (or at least, not right now):

 - Official Apple maintained projects like the Swift language. Although it would undoubtedly be impressive to work on them, it looks like the vast majority of the projects have been written using C++, or heavily rely on C++ code, which I'm not too familiar with. Chances of me slipping into those chunks of code seem pretty high... *Skip*
 - Networking/Parsing libraries. Are they useful? Yes. Are they used daily by tons of companies for different scale projects? Sure. Is my definition of "fun Friday night" trying to figure out why some rarely reproducible downcast fails 10% of the times? Not in my books. *Skip*
 - Some rad-looking UI component with thousands of stars that almost any iOS Software Engineer has heard of? *DING DING DING* that's where the sugar's at.

After looking at a bunch of libraries, I finally had my candidate: [SwiftMessages](https://github.com/SwiftKickMobile/SwiftMessages) . With over 6500 stars and 640 forks, the relevancy of this library was undisputed. On top of it all, I also had the chance to work with it in one of my past jobs, so my familiarity with the project would for sure give me an edge.

In particular, I decided to take care of [this](https://github.com/SwiftKickMobile/SwiftMessages/issues/207) "issue", which is technically a feature request. It seems manageable enough to get my feet wet in the Open Source world, but it's also something handy that I could picture people using in their day-to-day coding lives.
