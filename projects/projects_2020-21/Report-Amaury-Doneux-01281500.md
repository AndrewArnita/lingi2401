## Research and selection of a project

At first I coudn't think of any open source project that I was using. So I checked the open source projects that were flagged as "Great for new contributors". Within those projects, one caught my attention [HospitalRun](https://github.com/HospitalRun/hospitalrun-frontend). Unfortunately, some time passed and as I didn't have that much time left, I decided to move to another project (maybe I'll come back to this one later as I still think it's a good project). 
I tried to get some info on the project [nodejs] (https://github.com/nodejs/node) but it did seem a little to big as a first participation.
Finally, as time was flying, I decided to go for the [Exercism](https://github.com/exercism/java) project (the Java track). Indeed, some other students talked previously about it. So it seemed like a good project to start a first contribution in the open source world.

## Getting acquainted with the project

The first thing I did was to go to the main page of the Exercism project on github. This is where I learned by reading the readme that the project was divided in "tracks" (one by language). In the readme it was recommended to do some exercises on the platform before trying to contribute to the project to get a feeling of how the project was working. So, choosing the Java track I did some exercises on the platform and I found it quite interesting. I am currently doing the Java track but will surely do some other tracks after this one, as I discovered that Exercism is really usefull with a system of mentor that can give you tips on your solutions ! If you haven't ever done an exercise on Exercism, I really recommend you to do so, it is really worth it !
So after making some exercises and reading how the Java track was working, it was time to find how to contribute.

## Search of a contribution to make

To find what contribution I would do, I first checked the different issues and the different PR (to make sure not to take something that was already being done). I discovered that most issues were already attributed to someone (some were attributed almost a year ago). But most of them were still there which surprised me. Among the issues that were still available, I did not find any that seemed interesting for me. 

After thinking, I realised that while doing an exercise, I had found that the description was not detailed enough. Indeed, in the statement, it was said that we had to throw an exception or a particular value, without any further information. While in the tests they tested for a specific type of exception and wanted a specific messageâ€¦

I reported that issue and the fact that some tests did not seem relevant. Here is the [Issue](https://github.com/exercism/java/issues/1855).

And did my [PR](https://github.com/exercism/java/pull/1856).

For the time being I don't have any answer to the issue I reported, nor to my PR, but that might be expected as the V3 of Exercism should be released near the end of january. So most people are working on that part for now.

## Conclusion

Even though my PR hasn't been accepted yet, I already learned a lot and now I know the different steps necessary to participate to an open source project. As I know how the Exercism project now works, I will be more inclined to contribute to it. My hopes are that I will be able to continue to contribute to this project and if I can, I will try to find one or two other projects in which I could also participate. This way, I won't forget what I learned and will be able to learn more from the different projects. Plus, of course, it is a great way to construct myself a CV.
