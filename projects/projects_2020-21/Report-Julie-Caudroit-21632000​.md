<h1> Open Source Contribution Project </h1>
<em> Author </em> : Julie Caudroit <br>

<em> Selected project </em> : SpookyBot - Discord Bot <br>

<h2> Project Selection </h2>
Using Discord as much for private use as for studies in order to be able to benefit from an instant discussion for projects, 
I wanted to address the different OpenSource tools that could be found.
Finally, it was while searching through the different bots offered by the community that I found SpookyBot. 
Having never participated in an OpenSource project, I went to this bot in particular for its ease of understanding. 
It must be said that I saw several other OpenSource projects for discordant bots, but my knowledge in programming did not allow me to launch myself into the project reassured.
SpookyBot being quite easy to understand, I decided to take a special interest in it. 
So I started the experiment by adding a language, more precisely by translating words from English into Russian. 

<h2> SpookyBot </h2>
SpookyBot is a Discord bot who add some cute spooky terror on your server! ðŸŽƒ
This project is convenient for people who want to get into open source and contribute to different projects especially during the Hacktoberfest.
<em> What does he do?</em> <br>
For the moment, the bot reacts with emojis according to the words present in the messages. For example, if you send the following message: 
"I saw a ghost today", SpookyBot will add the reaction to the message.ðŸ‘» <br>
<em> What can I do? </em> <br>
Almost everything! Seriously, you can help me translate the robot into different languages or add new words and emojis to the list. 
Otherwise, you can help me add some cool commands to make the robot more fun to use!

<h2> My Contribution </h2>
For my part, I decided to translate the words from English into Russian and to further extend the number of languages translated, 
and thus the scope of the project in order to add some nice little reaction to animate a discordant server. <br>

<h2> What I have learned </h2>
I've learned that it's often more complicated to find a project that interests us and that happens to be in our skill set, than to actually get to work on it.
Understanding the environment in which we find ourselves, what is being sought, or what is required depending on how far along the project is, 
can be a real hindrance if the skills don't follow behind.
In other words, in order to be able to work on large projects, and not really on a human scale, and especially to be able to work on projects of all types in OpenSource, 
it is important to be quite versatile, but above all to know how to develop in several types of languages.
Once the understanding of the language has been acquired, and the expectations of the community, as well as of the instigator of the project, 
all that remains is to get started, following of course the rules imposed by the project.
