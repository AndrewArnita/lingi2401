# Open Source Project

## Motivation:
My main motivation in choosing an open source project to contribute to is based on a personal project that I am aiming to achieve sometime in the future, and that is having education free for everybody and accessible by everyone, because everybody has the recipe but not all of us have the ingredients. I believe that people should not pay to get educated, since not everyone has the capacities to do so, which limits the imagination and invention of the people that cannot afford school/university fees

### What Could have Been:
The main project that I wanted to contribute to [freeCodeCamp][fcc], which is a community that offers teaching coding for free, following a curriculum. I spent almost a month discussing with the owners of the project on discord, trying to figure out what how I can help and contribute which was the most difficult part since each time a new issue pops up it gets assigned to people that already contributed to them. 

### Process:
For freeCodeeCamp I had to use [Gitpod][gg], which gives a ready to go development environment instead of downloading it locally because it doesn't support Windows directly without WSL2. There exists a template which shows how the layout of the method/function (called challenge) should be, where each challenge will have its own ID created by their database. But then i stopped working since i wasnt assigned any of the issues, and i jumped to [30-seconds-of-code][scc].
To contribute to [30-seconds-of-code][scc], i had to download the whole project locally then i had to install the integration-tools globally on my machine, which allows me to customize the content of the repository. The contribution is in the form of snippets, where there exists a template to follow in order for the contribution to be accepted. After that, i had to run 'init-content-repo' where they ask what language am I going to use so that they prepare the snippet and then i had to run 'create-new-snippet <my-snippet-name>' to create the snippet file that i want.
 

### What I ended up doing:
So [30-seconds-of-code][scc]is a platform that allows people to contribute any function that they want and that they deemed it helpful. The main challenge here was the communication also, since there is no communication form or any platform where I can get in touch to ask them what functions are missing, also the initialisation of the project isn't well explained i had to search on my own. But after contributing twice different functions, both were rejected because one needed to be in another [https://github.com/30-seconds/30-seconds-of-code/pull/1707][repo] that also belongs to them, the second time it was because the function [(https://github.com/30-seconds/30-seconds-of-python/pull/417)][ff] that I wrote could’ve been done through a built-in function (Both functions were responsible for multiply the elements of list with each other using python). So for my next contribution I had to go over most of the functions that are already on the website, and then check if they can be done directly through a built in function, to avoid another contribution rejection.
The third contribution was actually a function that would calculate if the given year is a leap year or not using mathematical notations.
### 12/7/2020
My third contributions got rejected [(https://github.com/30-seconds/30-seconds-of-python/pull/418)][rr], for having a similar function in calendar.leap, which didn't really appear for me for some reason, but i ll keep on checking and then creating these small functions until one of them gets accepted.


### What I learned:
Contributing to open source projects isn’t a task to be taken lightly, in fact it requires communication skills as much as development skills. And i had to dig deep to understand the projects that are already on github and how to contribute to them, and to to find a good project that is related to what i want, because i didnt want to contribute to any project without a meaning for me.
Also, contributing to big projects is a bit tidiuous since there exists many contributors where some already have experience which gives them an advantage to being assigned an issue.
Other than that, it also tought me that people are actually interested in helping others, to teach otehrs for free which only helps me in my future project, but hopefully it will be for all majors not only programming.

# Exam Presentation

## Main idea:
Talk about Tuition Free Education
So, I already shared during my presentation, that I was working on a project but let me put it in a more formal way.

## Business Model:

### Name: 
For this software a very basic name: Tuition Free Education, the idea behind it is to offer education for free, of course its inspired by like freecodecamp which is also open source and khan academy which isn’t but actually have everything on it, is that it is not only programming or computer related education but actually every available major. 

### My targeted users: 
Anyone that wants to use it, but my focus are the people that are unable to access education for different reasons, either financial reasons or even if they didn’t want to attend classes, they can just invest in their free time to learn any new skill. 

### Marketing phase:
The best way I believe is though social media where let us say I make it sponsored on any of the platforms it will start appearing to everyone which also helps because this is a low budget high exposure model to follow. Especially that during these times people are inside of their homes and constantly on social media which makes the target easier to reach.  

Another way to do would be through opening a kiosk or through seminars but I do not believe that this method would be the best approach because I believe people do not really care about listening to someone speak rather than an ad popping up for them. 
### The distribution:
It will be through a website first which will be directly connected to a GitHub account which I will talk about in a bit. For the costs part, the costs will be related to the sponsoring of the software which will be approx. 300$ per month on Facebook, and 50$ for 2000 user on Instagram for it to be sponsored consistently appearing on their pages, + the costs if any of the used database to store the information, but other than that their won’t be any additional cost since the website is going to be done by my friend and I, and for the design is already done by another friend also, where there will be different themes. 

### Vision:
At the beginning it will be just university courses, but we have plans to expand it to even basic elementary school lessons. But all of this is a process so at the beginning it will be a bit costly and cumbersome in terms of communication, but eventually I believe it will help a bigger cause, and I do not believe that there should be just one owner but instead every author is responsible for his part, they can of course decide for it to be anonymous in case they don’t want their name to show up. I am not aiming to gain money from it, but a donation link can be added to each contributor.

GitHub, because I believe that the software should be decentralized by making everything available though open source where people can post the material, either slides or exercises regarding a specific course, and then it will be checked by us that it has relevant information not a meme or anything. The main emphasis here is that it’s for all the major, so without contributors the project does not hold, or it will become just like the other open-source projects where they deliver computer only related curriculums.

## Licenses:
Now to be honest before this course I was not aware of the different licenses like I knew the general one which is copyright but the CopyLeft licenses are something new to me. 
So, a license shows the guidelines for how the people can share and distribute the software in general there are two main categories the Copyright and CopyLeft. 

Copyrights exist in order to protect authors of documentation or software from unauthorized copying or selling of their work. 
And CopyLefts provides a method for software or documentation to be modified, and distributed back to the community, provided it remains Libre. By libre it means an author can place his or her copyright into the document. 

Now inside of these two exists multiple licenses, but for website software I believe the best license to use is BSD3-clause license, which allows users to use or modify the source code but they need to include the Copyright notice that I’ll include inside of my documents and that my name can’t be used to endorse their product, the list of conditions and the disclaimer that is provided by BSD3 which shows that I gave them the authority to use the code. 
The difference than BSD2 is the not including my name on it. 

Now my problem is regarding other authors I want to allow them to add their material, but I still did not decide which license should be used. I know that it is of course copyleft and there are different licenses either GPL (guarantee end users the freedom to run, study, share, and modify the software) or LGPL (A Lesser General Public License (LGPL) is a license for open-source software that allows for provisions for including elements of free software in either free or proprietary software).
