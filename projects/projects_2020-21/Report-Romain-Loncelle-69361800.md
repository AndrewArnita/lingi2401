## Project Selection
Given I was not a big user of open sources solution, I chose this course as an introduction to open sources project and how to get involved. I wanted to pick a project which wasn't too complex for my very first contribution and furthermore with a good community to avoid a bad experience as much as possible.
In line with those ideas and after struggling a bit on other projects, I finally found a project which could be part of my discovery process.

### Contributor Covenant

Contributor Covenant is basically a Code of Conduct for Open Source Projects and Communities.
The goal of this project is to make Open Source Projects available to every single person whoever you are.
Furthermore, it tries to make contributions to projects as accessible and welcoming as possible.
To do so, a Code of Conduct is written (and rewritten over the years) and made available to whoever wants to use it in his project. You can find several translations of this Code of Conduct.
Nevertheless, not all translations have the same version of the Code of Conduct (latest version 2.0), such as french which hasn't been updated for a while and is still in version 1.4.
The code of conduct has already been adopted by many Open Source Projects, some of them are already well known.
