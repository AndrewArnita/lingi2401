# Selection of the project

- At first, I wanted to contribute to one of python's big libraries. The problem here is that it is very hard to find an issue that is interesting and good for beginners. 
- I kept looking for a project in python but most of them seemed uninteresting to me.
- I searched for projects in other programming languages such as C and Java.
- I looked up the libraries in javascript and typescript that I was using for another project but as a mather of fact I did not have enough skills to contribute to one of those.
- After the deprecation of "Google Play Music", I decided to use an open source multimedia player and I found a thing that was bothering me so I posted an [issue](https://github.com/timusus/Shuttle/issues/523). Unfortunately, this project is dead, no one ever replied to me.
- I was looking for a project for 10 weeks so I decided to check out the Exercism repo because it seemed that each year, a few students of this course contributed to this project. I know that the project is kind of generic and it is not something that I use much but I had to find someting to work on. And there it was, the perfect [issue](https://github.com/exercism/v3/issues/2880). 

# Contribution to the project

*06-12-20*

Here we are, I found *the* issue, it was asked to improve a concept exercise in my all time favourite language (Python) about mu all time favourite data structure (`lists`).
I posted a comment to ask if I could implement it. No reply from anybody. I got bored and impatient so I decided to start working on it. All I had to do was to create and implement a few files:

- .docs/hints.md
- .docs/introduction.md
- .meta/design.md
- .concepts/lists/links.json 

I could also improve some other files but they really just seemed fine to me so I didn't. \
I had some questions about the way I was implementing the files so I asked them under the issue. No reply from anybody so I decided to do it my way. \
That night I still had no replies on the issue so I decided to do the [PR](https://github.com/exercism/v3/pull/2898). The first commit didn't pass because I forgot to apply prettier on my files. The second commit passed all the mandatory checks.

I still don't have any reply under the issue or the PR. I'm waiting for reviews and for some discussion because this journey feels pretty lonely so far.

*07-12-20 Later*

Around 8pm, the incredibly nice and wholesome maintainer [BethanyG](https://github.com/BethanyG) replied to me. She made a very kind and complete review of my commit and she even replied in details to the questions I asked on the issue. \
I commited all the changes she proposed and I modified the introduction and about documents to add explanations on the slice notation. \
There will be a discussion about the hint file because I might have given too many details or examples, we are waiting on the input from the person who posted the issue.

*08-12-20*

During the night, I received more replies from [BethanyG](https://github.com/BethanyG) and a review from the user who posted the issue [valentin-p](https://github.com/valentin-p). \ 
I modified the files according to their comments and commited. I am now once again waiting for their replies.
