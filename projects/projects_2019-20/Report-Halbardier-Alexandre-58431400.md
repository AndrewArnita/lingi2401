## What's youtube-dl

youtube-dl [https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl] is a program that allows you to download youtube videos from the command line of the computer.

## Why this project

- During the exam sessions, I am used to listening to music while I study. And to listen to music, it's even easier to download it!
- The community is quite active with pull requests which are evaluated fairly quickly.
- There were a lot of explanations to help people who wanted to contribute.

## What I did

There were many options that already existed, for example filtering videos that were too long or too old in a playlist. 
However, I noticed that we always had to provide the youtube url of the video or playlist we wanted to download otherwise an error was displayed. So we had to copy and paste the url to start the download, which was not very practical.
For my contribution, I decided to add an option, which allows you to just put the youtube name of a singer or youtuber, and without having to put the url, the program would download itself all the music videos of this singer. With one command, you can download the 50 videos of your favorite singer.

## Result of the contribution

Unfortunately, my pull request was not accepted, because it was out-of-scope according to them, probably because this shortcut was not in line with what the owners of the project wanted to do.

## Conclusion

I don't think I'm going to make another pull request for this project because of this, but maybe I'll add other shortcuts for my personal use.
It was hard to contribute because you have to get used to the project, to understand what is in which file, what is useful or not.
And even if it wasn't accepted it was very interesting to contribute to this project!
