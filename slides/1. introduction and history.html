#The realistic way to complete the project

class: center, middle

#History of free software
To put a bit of context

---
class: center, middle
#At first, every software were free
- Mostly academic
- Cost was the hardware
- Modifications were required for every hardware

---
class: center, middle
#Commercial software vs hackers
- Software cost money
- Source code is copyrighted
- Hobbyists or hackers were still exchanging source code
- Remember: no Internet

This guy had modified the software on the previous printer so you were notified when your print was done (because most people worked on a different floor than the printer). He realised he could not do it anymore with the new printer because the software was copyrighted and no source code were available.

Founder of the Free Software movement
---
class: center, middle
#Free Software philosophy
- People should be free
- So software should be free too
- So non-free software are unethical
- Software is not the meal, it's the recipe
---
class: center, middle
#Free as in free speech
- Free to use
- Free to study
- Free to modify
- Free to redistribute
---
class: center, middle
# What is freedom?
Free to use your own definition of freedom

???
My personal take: free to use means that it should be usable. Something that is not user-friendly enough (for instance) is not very free to use in a certain way.

    From: torvalds@klaava.Helsinki.FI (Linus Benedict Torvalds)
    Newsgroups: comp.os.minix
    Subject: What would you like to see most in minix?
    Summary: small poll for my new operating system
    Message-ID: <1991Aug25.205708.9541@klaava.Helsinki.FI>
    Date: 25 Aug 91 20:57:08 GMT
    Organization: University of Helsinki
    
    Hello everybody out there using minix â€“
    
    Iâ€™m doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, wonâ€™t be big and
    professional like gnu) for 386(486) AT clones. This has been brewing
    since april, and is starting to get ready. Iâ€™d like any feedback on
    things people like/dislike in minix, as my OS resembles it somewhat
    (same physical layout of the file-system (due to practical reasons)
    among other things).
    
    Iâ€™ve currently ported bash(1.08) and gcc(1.40), and things seem to work.
    This implies that Iâ€™ll get something practical within a few months, and
    Iâ€™d like to know what features most people would want. Any suggestions
    are welcome, but I wonâ€™t promise Iâ€™ll implement them ðŸ™‚
    
    Linus (torvalds@kruuna.helsinki.fi)
    
    PS. Yes â€“ itâ€™s free of any minix code, and it has a multi-threaded fs.
    It is NOT protable (uses 386 task switching etc), and it probably never
    will support anything other than AT-harddisks, as thatâ€™s all I have :-(.

#Open Source Initiative
- Eric Raymond and Bruce Perens in 1998

- Business are afraid of free software

#Open Source philosophy
- Open Source is the best way to develop complex software
- It's the only way for really complex software
- The Cathedral and the Bazaar

# Free Software vs Open Source
- Free software because it's better for humans, even if software are less good.
- Open source because it's better for software development.

- Free software won't compromise. Non-free software are to be avoided.
- Open source looks for compromises and may even help proprietary software.

Still ongoing war of terms; in practice and for most people, it refers to the same thing.
