## Research and Selection of the Project
### Exercism

Exercism is a platform where everyone can learn about programming. At the moment, Exercism is developping is version 3 and need a lot of help
in order to make this third version available. A lot of programming langages are available especially Java and Python that are my go to langage
when I have/want to do something. Passionnated by teaching make my first exercice available would be a great first step in this way.

### Fedora

An other solution (less likely) would be to make a contribution to Fedora which is my day to day OS. However, viewing the size of this software
it may be too large for a first contribution.
