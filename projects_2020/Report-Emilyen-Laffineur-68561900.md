## Research and Selection of the Project
### Exercism

Exercism is a platform where everyone can learn about programming. At the moment, Exercism is developping is version 3 and need a lot of help
in order to make this third version available. A lot of programming langages are available especially Java and Python that are my go to langage
when I have/want to do something. Passionnated by teaching make my first exercice available would be a great first step in this way.
More information: [here](https://github.com/exercism/v3).

### Fedora

An other solution (less likely) would be to make a contribution to Fedora which is my day to day OS. However, viewing the size of this software
it may be too large for a first contribution.
More information: [here](https://github.com/topics/fedora-project) and [here](https://github.com/fedora-infra).


## Selection

22/09
After some reflection it seems that Fedora is a too big project to begin with. I decided to go with Exercism.

## Getting into the project

22/09
First of all, I look for the way they use to have someone on the project.
Following the readme I choose the language for the one I want to develop something (Java).
Once you have selected a language you access the list of exercices that need to be developped at the moment.
One of the opened Java exercise at that moment is an exercise about case-statement. (You can find it [here](https://github.com/exercism/v3/issues/1963))

Everything that need to be develop is well documented with the things we need to know before starting contribute, the goal of the project, etc.

In order to work on this exercice I just had to write a comment saying that I'm interested in doing that.

Some hours later I had an answer from [mirko](https://github.com/mirkoperillo) saying that they assigned me the issue.
The same exercice already exists for C#. As Java and C# are very close langage I was just ask to "translate" the C# code into Java.
