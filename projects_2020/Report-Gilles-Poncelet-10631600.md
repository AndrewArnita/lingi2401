## Research and Selection of the Project

I have several projects in mind I would like to contribute to. However, at this moment, I still have no idea what kind of contribution I might be able to do (either for difficulty reasons or simply by a lack of ideas). Therefore, I first wanted to simply list some ideas here and will eventually choose a specific one.

#### Mariant NMT

This is an open-source Neural Machine Translation used by Microsoft. I recently used it in a fun project that was sort of a challenge from a friend. You can find more details about it [here](https://github.com/SnaKyEyeS/NeoLanguage). \
However I fear this might be a little too complex a project to be properly able to contribute as my knowledge in Deep Learning or Machine Leanrning in general is limited. \
Marian's website can be found [here](https://marian-nmt.github.io/) and its dev repo [here](https://github.com/marian-nmt/marian-dev).


#### Flask

With two friends, we've created a web-application called [ADE-Scheduler](https://ade-scheduler.info.ucl.ac.be) - which is itself an [open source project](https://github.com/SnaKyEyeS/ADE-Scheduler). This application uses the Flask micro-framework as its backend fondation. As opposed to Django, it is not "battery-included", meaning that it relies on a lot of independtly maintained packages so that one might be able to build a complete application. \
More specifically, we've been using the excellent [Flask-Security](https://github.com/Flask-Middleware/flask-security) package to manage all security aspects (login, user regsitration, user confirmation, etc.) of our website. While this is a great package, it is still under very active development and I would love to be able to contribute, simply to fix some bugs we've potentially encountered during our use of this package or even to participate to the development of the currently work-in-progress 4.0 release.
