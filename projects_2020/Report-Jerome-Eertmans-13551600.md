## Research and Selection of the Project

	As I am a frequent user of numerical libraries in Python, I would like to contribute to one of them. The one which can still grow a lot, in my opinion, is [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) and it is why I would like to contribute to this great package.
