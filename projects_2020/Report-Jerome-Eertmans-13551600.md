## Research and Selection of the Project

As I am a frequent user of numerical libraries in Python, I would like to contribute to one of them. The one which can still grow a lot, in my opinion, is [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) and it is why I would like to contribute to this great package.


## How to contribute

Even though I am not new to Github, it is my first experience contributing to another open source project. Fortunately, the pandas development team wrote a [contribution guide](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/development/contributing.html#where-to-start)
