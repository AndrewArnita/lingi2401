## Project Research and selection
I never really participate in any open source project before. So I was kinda lost when I had to choose one.
I didn't know which one I will work on but I was sure on one thing: "I want to collaborate on open source that I was currently using so that I could already have an idea about the goal of the project. But also because I want to contribute to tools that help me as a way of thanking their creators for their work."

### Libre Office
The first project that came directly to my mind, since I already use it a lot was Libre Office. It's a great tool for making different types of documents as Powerpoint, excel, normal text file, ... and has a large use in the open source world.

The only big problem with this kind of project is that it's way to big for an open source beginner like me. I will probably waste a lot of my time in understanding how to contribute to it and I have a high chance to be lost. So I decided to pass my way on this one.

### Notepad++
Another great tool that kinda always uses since my studies in computer science is Notepad++. For those who don't know, Notepad++ is a text or source code editor which supports a lot languages. We can say that it's a Notepad improvement as C++ for C.
