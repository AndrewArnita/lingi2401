Research and selection of the project :
To choose a project to work on, I first tried to find applications that I use and that are beginner-friendly. I didn't really find anything attractive.
I then searched projects that are mentionned as good first projects on Github. I found exercism, a site to learn computer languages. I liked the idea. As I am most confortable on Java, I tried to contribute on the Java part but didn't find an issue that was sparkling. 
I then learned that exercism is currently making a "migration" to an other approach, with new types of exercises. I decided to participate to it as it is clearly quite active and there is a lot to be done still.

Contribution :
I picked an exercise that was in the issue and asked if I could resolve it. It was then accepted.
In exercism, people are trying to make every exercise with the same structure (files, presentation, style, ...). There are a lot of documentation on what is expected for each exercise and how it should be presented (even with videos sometimes). It helped a lot to get going. Also the PR that got accepted on other exercises helped me to understand what problems could arise.
I wrote the exercise and then submitted a PR. It got automatically refused first as I forgot to run the tests on the style of some files. I corrected the mistakes and resubmitted it. It got accepted by the bot, to be reviewed by managers of the Java part.
I am now waiting for their answer to make changes if necessary.


Conclusion : 
I learned a lot during this project. First the mass of open-source projects on internet that still expect contribution, and especially the number of useful projects that try to help new contributors.
I also learned that it is pretty easy to begin contributing. A lot of the projects try to be approchable.
