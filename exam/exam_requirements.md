# Exam requirements

## Date & Place

January 25th, BARB20

## Schedule

The schedule is uploaded on the GitHub project of the course (exam_2017.csv). Students are allowed to switch their schedule by proposing a merge request of a modification of the file. In the merge request comment, the requester should ping the other student affected by the change. It is the responsibility of the requester to ensure that the other student agreed with the switch.

## Dress code

Extravagant disguise or costume might be a good opportunity to laugh. If you did a bet to pass an exam in some unexpected attires, please do! Else, come as usual.

## The exam

Student enter the room at the time of her/his schedule. She/he draw a card from a list of questions. The student has then a maximum of 40 minutes to prepare an answer to the question. She/he can use whatever ressource, including a laptop with an Internet connection. At the end of the 40 minutes (or earlier if the student has finished), professor and student start a discussion about the project and the question. After the discussion, both go through the grad grid (exam_grid.ods). A final mark is then issued. The discussion will have a maximal duration of 20 minutes.

## Ressources

There's no rules regarding ressources. A laptop that can connect to the UCL/Eduroam Wifi is needed. A spare laptop will be available in case of emergency but it is advised that students bring one with which they are familiar.

As the student can spend as long as 60 minutes in the room, it is advised for students to take their precautions (going to toilets before) and to bring food/drink.

## Questions

Questions will be about a project or a group of projects not studied in class. Some subquestions will be asked but the student is tasked to demonstrate that he quickcly understood what the question was about and to display a strong understanding of the concepts seen in class by applying them to the project.

Reading the Wikipedia page about the project is not particularly interesting.
