## Find the project 
After the first class I was looking for a project that allows me to work outside of my comfort zone but at the same time I wanted something that I can finish in a reasonable time.  
I began to look some advices in google and also the suggestion that the professor give us in his repository git. When I check all the possible projects, I was already convinced to work in the [exercism/java](https://github.com/exercism/java)  project. Why? Because this project wasn’t a big one, neither small one, the community's size was the perfect one for me. Also, the content was perfect, and I liked the idea. 

What is exercism? This project is a [plataform](https://exercism.io) that allows you to learn programing languages. Firstly, the students need to submit the exercise in command line form their computers and the can check the result in the [website](https://exercism.io). Also, there is a volunteering community that helps (give advices, correct, if you don’t know how to solve the exercise, they can guide you, etc.). This is in the practical side, in the other side there is a community that crate the exercises and this community is in GitHub. There are different tracks (different programing languages) to crate the exercises. There is also a common track [ problem-specifications](https://github.com/exercism/problem-specifications ) where you can find the list of exercises to implement (“normally” you can also create new exercises and submit here before implement in a specific track).
My idea was to create a new exercise in this common track and after, implement it in the java/track. 
Before submitting the project name in the GitHub class's proposition, I checked if my ideal contribution was possible, because I wanted to have an accepted pull request before this project’s deadline. I started to check orders pull request in the java/track and get the time’s average for the accepted ones in the last time (I didn't check all), this average wasn’t bad around one month and the worst one was two month and half (including corrections in the pull request). So, for me was good. I had the project for contributions and the professor accepted my proposition.  jupi jupi !!

## Work Hard
The first thing was to do my pull request as soon as possible in order to have time make correction if it was requested and resubmit it in time, so no time to procrastination. So I began explore the possible exercise, I checked the existing exercises  in the common track and I realized that they have good ideas and a lot of exos but they didn’t have much related to Object-oriented programming (OOP) so I decide to contribute in that way. I realize that we have this kind of exos in first year of bachelor, so I tried to inspire me from this. When I found a good idea related of the java class, I wrote to a professor in order to make sure that I wasn’t incurring in any king of right (license issues or another problem). The professor for the class told me that, It wasn’t problem. So, I inspired me from his idea, but I transformed the whole exercise. 

### Writing some code
I create the instructions and the small story to introduce the exo. I use the common instruction from the other exercises already created in the track (how to install and run the exo). After that I began the exercice's code that allows you to practice in OOP, you need to create some classes and methods related to the topic Shapes. You can see the code in the pull request. For that exo you need to have 3 parts. The first one the exercise, the incomplete code that allows the students to practice, the second one the test, you need to have all possible tests Junit and they need to fallows some characteristic to stay in the same programing style this is also valid for all the code that you submit. The final and third one the solution for the exercise that you’re proposing. I did the 3 parts, the proposal and the instructions (around 688 lines) so It's a completed exercise. 
At the same time when I was completing all the procedure, I realized that they weren’t accepting exercises in common track because they were restructuring the project as I said before. So, in order to make sure I wasn’t losing my time I asked [here](https://github.com/exercism/java/issues/1740 ) and also in a group conversation if I was allowed to propose a new exercise. After some exchange they said yes but I needed to add my pull request directly in the java track instead of the common track and off course they will decide after if the pull request is accepted or not. So, I continued to put the last corrections and the 2nd October I submitted my [pull request](https://github.com/exercism/java/pull/1759). When Is submitted it, it didn’t pass all the regulars tests (they have automatics tests that checks if you'd fallowed the normal steps) because I was doing a procedure that wasn’t the standard one.  I put the exercise directly in the specific java track and not in the common track. The code compilation was fine but not the step compilation. The hard work was completed and now I need to wait for someone that helps me to correct the failed test.

## Long waiting 
As I saw in other cases in this same project, when someone make a pull request (PR) the team reviews it and said what to change or in the worst case they close it. So I decide to wait for this reviewer. I the middle time I fixed one bug (related to the exo priority) and I commit in the same (PR). After exactly one month I didn’t receive any review and for me was not normal but not bizarre. I decided to push them and I was looking for some active community’s member. I found a very nice girl (Frida) I tag her, and I wait again. After 2 day she answer me with regulars news (you can see it in the comment of the pull request) She was not confident if she can allow a new procedure without consulting with the other members. So she decided to consult before take any decisions. They didn’t accept my PR but they didn’t close neither, I decide to wait again for their consensus. 
I wait, wait, wait, … in the middle you can see that I push they 3 times, so they cannot forget me, every time they had an argument for me. The last time was at the end of the course, in case they answered me I had time to react before the exam. 
My hoppe was to have any answer by January. I waited until the last possible day to submit the rapport but the response never came. So sad !! :(

## Conclusion
The goal of this project was to interact, help with an existing open source project, I in the best case get an accepted pull request. 
In may case I worked from the begging in order to have a good experience with this community, help them and at the same time get experience. In one way I feel bad because my pull request wasn’t answered, and I think my PR is a grate OOP excercise for this platform. In the other hand, I feel that I accomplished the objective, I did every think to contribute to exercism in the way that I wanted and at the same time being respectfully with the project. Maybe my decision to contribute with a new exercise wasn’t the best idea in the middle of the project restructuration. I think in general the people get stook in the middle when the new policies arrives because the coordination is not the best. 
In any cases It was a good experience I learn to wait, hahah. This experience give me also an idea of how complicated can be to manage a team and also make new restructuration in an open source project.
